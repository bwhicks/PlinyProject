Although there is considerable distinguished print scholarship on the people of Pliny, few if any online resources exist to facilitate a simple search for Pliny&#x27;s correspondents or their own biography when it is known.</p><p>I collected a considerable amount of data from a thorough analysis of Pliny&#x27;s letters under the auspices of a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome. Subsequently I am now mining it for conclusions, and attempting to make it available online for other scholars to use in their research, with the gracious support of research release time at the<a href=\\"https://cdh.princeton.edu\\">Center for Digital Humanities</a> at Princeton.</p></main></div>"`;
